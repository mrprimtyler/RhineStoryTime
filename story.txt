A man named Brot was planning on going to a Rammstein concert.
On his way to the concert, Brot decides to have bratwurst and apfelkuchen in his Porsche for dinner.
Brot then drove down hauptstrasse, spotting a schloss in the distance as he headed towards Berlin.
As Brot approached the Schloss, a wild Hund in Lederhose burst out of a nearby Baeckerei, knocked over a tray of Gebaeck, and chased Brot's Porsche toward the Flughafen in a cloud of flour and confusion.
Shockingly, Brot looked to his left and saw a mehlhase riding shotgun!
