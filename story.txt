A man named Brot was planning on going to a Rammstein concert.
On his way to the concert, Brot decides to have bratwurst and apfelkuchen in his Porsche for dinner.
Brot then drove down hauptstrasse, spotting a schloss in the distance as he headed towards Berlin.
As Brot approached the Schloss, a wild Hund in Lederhose burst out of a nearby Baeckerei, knocked over a tray of Gebaeck, and chased Brot's Porsche toward the Flughafen in a cloud of flour and confusion.
Brot stopped his car as he was afraid to hit the wild Hund and decided to try to lure it to him with some Doener he had on him.
