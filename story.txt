A man named Brot was planning on going to a Rammstein concert.
On his way to the concert, Brot decides to have bratwurst and apfelkuchen in his Porsche for dinner.
But as he was about to take the first bite of his Bratwurst, a lost lady wearing a Dirndel knocked on his window to ask where the Haupstrasse was.
Brot then drove down hauptstrasse, spotting a schloss in the distance as he headed towards Berlin.
As Brot approached the Schloss, a wild Hund in Lederhose burst out of a nearby Baeckerei, knocked over a tray of Gebaeck, and chased Brot's Porsche toward the Flughafen in a cloud of flour and confusion.
To make matters worse, Brot's Klimaanlage in his Porsche started blowing out flour, destroying a Dirndel he had in the back seat.
