A man named Brot was planning on going to a Rammstein concert.
On his way to the concert, Brot decides to have bratwurst and apfelkuchen in his Porsche for dinner.
Brot then drove down hauptstrasse, spotting a schloss in the distance as he headed towards Berlin.
When he finally arrived in Berlin, Brot stopped at the first Biergarten he saw to kill some time before the concert.
